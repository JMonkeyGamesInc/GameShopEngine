GameShop is 3D Modeling Software that takes full Advantage of Bezier Based Modeling.  We call this CurrencyMesh.  It also has a Custom Mesh Painting Format called ATMS. 

Right now it saves a File in the Documents Folder called "hi.file".  This is a test file.  Custom File Formats are being Created.  These File Formats will be interpreted by a Game Engine.  It provides 3D Modeling 100x as effective as Blender.
