For use with the JMonkeyEngine.  This will be Blenders Successor.

Its possible to Port to any Game Engine such as Unity or Godot.  Will do in the future.

GameShop is 3D Modeling Software that takes full Advantage of Bezier Based Modeling.  We call this CurrencyMesh.  It also has a Custom Mesh Painting Format called ATMS. 

Right now it saves a File in the Documents Folder called "hi.file".  This is a test file.  Custom File Formats are being Created.  These File Formats will be interpreted by a Game Engine.  It provides 3D Modeling 100x as effective as Blender.
